    "## Steps for Performing Big-Oh Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Identify each primitive operation in the code block\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Count how many times each primitive operation is executed\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. Calculate the running time by summing the counts of primitive operations\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. Perform a Big-Oh analysis on the computed running time\n",
    " \n",
    "Note (3): When counting primitive operations we'll ignore the line beginning with the keyword $def$ which serves as the function’s signature since we care about the running time of the function's body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note (4): Remember we're assuming all primitive operations will have the same constant execution time which allows us to simply count how many times each primitive operation executes and sum up the resulting counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note (5): Also remember if we know a finite number of primitive operations are executing but we can't count the exact amount since the implementation details are being abstracted away (like in Python for loops), then we'll use constant variables to represent the number of executed primitive operations for that line of code.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Note (6): This approach of using constant variables will still allow us to use Big-Oh analysis to correctly identify the growth rate since Big-Oh allows us to ignore lower-order terms and constant factors."
